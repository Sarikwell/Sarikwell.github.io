    Creed II is a 2018 American sports drama film directed by Steven Caple Jr., and written by Sylvester Stallone and Juel Taylor. A sequel to Creed (2015) and the eighth installment in the Rocky film series, it stars Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson, Dolph Lundgren, Wood Harris, Russell Hornsby, Andre Ward, and Phylicia Rashad. Creed writer-director Ryan Coogler serves as an executive producer on the film. The film follows Adonis Creed training in order to defeat the son of Ivan Drago, the powerful athlete who killed his father in the ring more than 33 years prior. 

A Creed sequel was confirmed in January 2016, although due to both Coogler and Jordan's involvement in Black Panther, the film was delayed, with Coogler ultimately being replaced by Caple. Stallone completed the script in July 2017 and announced Lundgren would be reprising his role as Drago, and filming began in Philadelphia in March 2018, lasting through July. 

Creed II is scheduled to be released in the United States by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on November 21, 2018, and internationally by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its direction and performances, especially those of Jordan, Thompson, and Stallone

    There are 8,000 miles of roads and paths in New York City and for the past six years Matt Green has been walking them all - every street, park, cemetery, beach, and bridge. It's a five-borough journey that stretches from the barbershops of the Bronx to the forests of Staten Island, from the Statue of Liberty to Times Square, with Matt amassing a surprisingly detailed knowledge of New York's history and people along the way. Something of a modern-day Thoreau, Matt gave up his former engineering job, his apartment, and most of his possessions, sustaining his endeavor through couch-surfing, cat-sitting and a $15-per-day budget.
